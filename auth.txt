# Django view authorization is typically done with decorators
# Use HttpRequest and HttpRequest.user.objects
# Authenticate and authorize users 
# Diffrentiate between regular, staff, and admin users
# Secure a view with the @login_required decorators
# Restrict a view to different roles with the @user_passes_test decorators
